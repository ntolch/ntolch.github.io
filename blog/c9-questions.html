      What's wrong with this post? Like, the words and stuff, what's wrong with them? You might already be able to come up with some things I could change, but it'd be helpful to have some more info--a little background, a little insight, a little clarification on what, exactly, I'm asking for. Right?

    <p>
      What makes a good question? A big part of it is providing context and enough background to help the askee understand where the question is coming from.

      This is a common trend I see in posts with coding question. Questions like "Can someone explain why I'm getting this error...?" without providing the code that got you there or what you're trying to accomplish can lead to an unanswered question or a lot of back-and-forth.
    </p>

    <p>
      So make sure your question is specific and you provide enough detail so that others can replicate the problem you're having. Let me re-ask my question. I'm worried I might have some grammatical errors in the body of this post. Can you proof-read it to see if there are any? Now if I hadn't gotten more specific with my question or provided you with the entirity of the post, I may have unnecessarily had my feelings hurt when you came back with all sorts of other things wrong with this post. Glad I clarified that I'm only asking about grammatical errors! Phew!
