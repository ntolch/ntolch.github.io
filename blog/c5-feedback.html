      Ah, pairing. Pairing success seems to be based completely on how well my pair and I communicate with each other. Which means I've some great and some could've-been-better pairing sessions. It's definitely great when:
      <ul>
        <p>- We're not afraid to have different ideas</p>
        <p>- We're both receptive of the other's ideas</p>
        <p>- The challenge is more of a conversation about what might work</p>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      When the challenge becomes a conversation, it's easier for me to learn from my pair and to teach them something in turn. Love that.
    </p>
    <p>
      It can make things more difficult when I don't convey my thoughts enough. My pair ends up having to guess what's going on inside my head, which doesn't make for a fantastic session.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reading through my most recent pieces of feedback felt pretty good. I've had some great sessions, and it's good to know that others agree! Plus, it's really cool to know what other people think of me and of working with me--I've always been curious about that kind of thing. I've decided to pick out one or two pieces of constructive feedback at a time. One thing I've noticed in some of my feedback points to something I already know about myself--I don't always say all of what I'm thinking. I can be hard to read, and when people guess at what I'm feeling/thinking or think they know, they tend to be wrong. It's a hard balance, though. Some of the things I can do better on are things I've sacrificed in order to keep the traits that I've been complimented on (like being a good listening and receptive and collaborative). But I'll need to keep working on finding that balance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Writing feedback can be a bit difficult as well. Especially if the session felt more average than great. I find that I focus on the same things every time--what I mentioned above about what make a great session for me. I know there are other things to take into consideration, but nothing else comes to mind. The problem is that those things often feel a little abstract. And it's hard to measure those things and put them into words (for me, anyway).
    </p>
    <p>
      On the scale of helpfulness, I think the feedback rates pretty low. The actual practice is, of course, much more helpful in getting better at working with others. But it is a chance to get into the habit of thinking more deeply about what made a pairing session good or bad and what makes a good pairing in general. And though I generally prefer to work on the coding challenges alone, pairing adds a new dynamic (and challenge) that I'm hoping will help strengthen my skillset and prepare me for the real world.
