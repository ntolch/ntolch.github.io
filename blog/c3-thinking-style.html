      My biggest struggle so far in Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp has been clearly communicating complex thoughts and ideas to others. 
      Particularly verbally. I think that may be because of my thinking style: abstract. According to Professor Anthony Gregorc, 
      there are 4 main thinking styles, and I scored equally in Abstract Random and Abstract Sequintial. And it makes sense.
      I mean, it matches up with what I know about myself. I love the world of theory and abstract thought, and I organization 
      information through reflection. At least, that's what the internets tell me. It also happens to be true. 
      Anyway, I've been wondering what to do about this. This struggle of mine.

      Practice would probably help. I may try, not just talking more, but talking a lot more. This'll help me get more practice 
      in, and even though I'm sure to fee like I'm over-explaining (compared to my usual style of acting like people can just 
      read my mind), I may also be better able to see what works and start to find patterns that'll help me explain myself 
      more concisely while being more consistently successful.

      Another thing I should probably try is talking more in facts and beginning fewer sentences with "I feel..." or "It seems..." 
      Wish me luck! I think I can, I think I can, I think I can...
