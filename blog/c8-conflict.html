    <p>
      Once upon a time...I had a conflict with a coworker. I know, very unusual, right? Anyway, here was the situation. She thought I was emotionally depressed. And she tried to convince me of it (or get me to admit it) through a 30-minute conversation. Of course, I knew that I wasn't. But she was convinced that I either was depressed or that I should be. Apparently, I was showing signs of being generally unmotivated.
    </p>

    <p>
      I was frustrated, to say the least. But more than that, I felt as though she wasn't respecting my decisions and my lifestyle. I felt she was being very un-accepting of a life and attitude about life that was different  from hers. I also felt she was telling me that I had a crappy and depressing life when I felt really good about my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      My solution at the time to resolve the conflict had been to simply (and repeatedly) tell her that I wasn't depressed. That I was perfectly fine. Having now broken down my emotions and having a better understanding of what I was feeling, I would have done it a bit differently. I would've told her how her analysis of my life and supposed state of mind made me feel. Ah, well. Maybe next time.
