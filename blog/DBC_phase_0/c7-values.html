  <h1>Values</h1>

    <p>
      When I'm feeling my best, my top values (and how hard I try to live up to them on a scale from 1 to 5) are:
        <p>- Meaningful work - 5 </p>
        <p>- Coolness under fire - 5 </p>
        <p>- Helping others - 4 </p>
        <p>- Personal development - 4 </p>
    </p>
    <p>
      The last time someone asked for my advice, they were trying to hack their sleep schedule (something I'd been working on). I relate this to mh own value of personal development.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the most part, I don't think my top values are connected to any stereotype threats I'm likely to face. I'm not sure what, if anything, that says about me. Part of me wonders if it's an indication that I've already let some stereotypes define me. Excellence, for instance, isn't one of my values, even though it seems like a excellent thing to have. I also don't feel particularly excellent at anything, and don't know that it's in me to be excellent. Am I giving into a stereotype? Or maybe it just means that I'm not overly converned with how I may be 'stereotyped.'
    </p>
    <p>
      My value of personal developement is the one area I think could hold a stereotype threat for me. I generally perceive others that are also interested in personal development as better than me at it--particularly, I've noticed, males. And sometimes I worry that I may not be knowledgable enough to share my thoughts in a discussion on personal dev techniques. One strategy I'll try using to get over this is being honest with myself about what I do and don't know, and sharing the things I personally find interesting and what I find interesting about them. If it's something I care enough about to have some kind of opinion on, then it should be worth sharing with others.
