      Hi there, past self. It's time for an AH-HA moment! Where the AH stands for Arrays & Hashes (in ruby). After this little lesson,
      you'll be saying "HA! I get it now! AH-HA!"
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll start with arrays. In the coding language, ruby (and some other languanges), an array is a just a list of items.
      It looks something like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code class="p-code">power_puff_girls = ['sugar', 'spice', 'everything nice']</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      And you access the items in the list by using it's placement within the list. So if you want to use 'everything nice'
      in some other bit of your super special secret code, you get to with <code>power_puff_girls[2]</code>. Yeah, 'everything
      nice' is the third item, but we coders usually start counting from zero. (Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it.) So the
      <code>[2]</code> part is called the index. The ingredient 'everything nice' is at index 2. Get it? Got it? Ok, good.
    </p>
    <p>
      So what's a hash, you wonder? A hash in the wonderful language of ruby is sort of like a dictionary. It's a collection of
      key-value pairs. A hash looks something like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code class="p-code">number_of_heros = {power_puffs: 3, batman_duo: 2, one_direction: 5}</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      You also use an index to get access to a single value in a hash. But with hashes, the items aren't actually stored in any
      particular order. They could come back in an order other than what you put them in. So the index of a value, instead of
      being it's position, is the key. To get to the value of 'one_direction', you'd use
      <code>number_of_heros[:one_direction]</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ok, so what's the difference? When should you use one over the other? It's pretty simple, really. When you need a list,
      use an array. When you need to store a little extra info with your items, use a hash.
