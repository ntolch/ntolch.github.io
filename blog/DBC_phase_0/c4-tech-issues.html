      Diversity in tech. Yeah, it's problem. Diversity is important not just for the sake of being able to say "We're
      diverse!" There are actual benefits that come from it. I'm gonna group the majority of reasons that we need more
      diversity into one: diversity makes teams better.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's almost sad that you may have seen this statement or its equivalent as the attention grabber in article. In several
      articles, really. It could very well be titleized, it's so headline worthy. This is still being treated as news.
      Studies show that diversity in teams makes for more creative, more energetic, more productive team mates. How do solve
      for the lack of diversity? So glad you asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're working with or for companies that don't have a diversity policy, ask them why. Start a conversation (a
      friendly debate, even!) and make them wonder whether they're doing all they can to promote diversity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Focus on company culture, not just hiring for diversity. Diversity isn't just a problem in the pipeline. Make yours
      a culture that promotes diversity and attracts all sorts of people, regardless of where they're from or what they
      look like.
    </p>
    <p>
      Get everyone involved. Diversity isn't just a [insert minority group]'s problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take another look at job postings and interview practices. Look for hidden biases that push away minorities.
