      Ok, past self, listen up. I’m going to be throwing some knowledge at you (a lot) until…when until I think you’ve had enough. Well, until you know as much as I do (which isn’t likely to ever to happen), it won’t be enough—not even close. But it should be enough to get you hooked. Sit back, kid. I’m about to introduce you to wonderful world of coding.

      Let’s start with my favorite word of the week:  commit. A commit happens when you change a project. In version control, all of your commits can be saved to a different version (or branch) of the original project. Then, whenever you’re ready, you can merge your final changes (commits) with the original (master) so you have one big, happy project! Developers (and developers-to-be, like your past self’s truly) use commits and version control to keep track of changes to their code.

      Git is a type of version control. Your Git files live on your own computer and only there. Unless, of course, you make them accessible from other computers. GitHub is a very up-and-coming website that you can choose to upload your Git files to and make it so that you, and even others, can take a look at them. You know that version control thing I was just telling you about? Well, with version control, GitHub is pretty handy for collaborating. A whole group of people can work on the most current version of the same file and merge them together from their own computer through GitHub.

      Oh, I forgot to tell you why “commit” has become my new favorite word for the week. Not only is it a word that has another definition we already knew, but it also sounds like comet! Recently, I saw someone’s Facebook profile picture change to a comet. When asked why, she said, “Com et me, bro!” And golly, I just thought that was so funny! I don’t know where your corny sense of humor comes from, past self. But it brings me a lot of joy, even if it also makes people think I’m lame.
