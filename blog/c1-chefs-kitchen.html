      I’ll admit. Some of the cultural aspects of DBC that made me super psyched to attend, also made me a bit wary. I facilitated frequently between the two, my brain bringing up points and counter points in equal numbers (if not equal in weight). I’m sure this was in large part thanks to first reading some awesome, glowing reviews and checking out DBC’s website, then see some pretty harsh criticisms from former alumni. I know that, like with everything that can be rated (even great things), this could be expected. But still. I mean, these nay-sayers were talking about the very concepts that drew me in!
    </p>
    <p>
      So what were my two sides saying about DBC?
    </p>
    <p>
      Empathy Engineering! How neat! I’ve read up on studies that show the importance of EQ. How nice to see a school promoting it. Learning how to learn? I’m totally down for that. … chance to redo phases … work with others and learn from them … networking and job assistance … Yes, yes and yes!
    </p>
    <p>
      Wait, I’ll have to talk about, like, my feelings and stuff? How can I be sure how much development I’ll actually learn? What if everyone’s too mushy and more worried about “expressing themselves” than learning? And, hold up, I’m broke. Couldn’t I learn everything on my own for free?
    </p>
    <p>
     Most of my doubts were coming from fear. Realizing that was a big help in my attempts to be objective about my pre-evaluation of DBC.
   </p>
   <p>
      Confession Time: I used the past tense when I talked about my   competing impressions of DBC. I still have a little of back-and-forth thing going on. But every time my doubting brain brings me back around to the question, “Do you really want to do this?”, the answer is always yes.
