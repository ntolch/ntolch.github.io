  <h1>Should I Feel Threatened?</h1>
  <h4>August 16, 2015</h4>

    <p>
      Stereotype threat. Growing up, I was vaguely aware of the concept through its cousin, Self-Fulfilling Prophecy. When someone is aware of a stereotype that he believes he might have the power to confirm, he may actually be more likely to do just that.
    </p>
      There are certainly insecurities I've worried about confirming. Whenever I talk to someone about a topic on which I perceive them to be more knowledgeable, for instance, I tend to keep my mouth shut more often for fear of sounding dumb. Then I worry that I appear dumb because I'm not saying anything on the subject. I'm not sure, though, that it qualifies as a stereotype threat because I don't have a stereotype in mind when this happens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being of mixed race, I never really felt that I 'belonged' to a particular race or even cultural group. I think that carried over into other aspects of my life, and I'm never sure which stereotypes are supposed to apply to me. My insecurities, while very common, are sort of my own, so to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I don't know...should I be more aware of the stereotypes I'm dealing with? Would it help me fight them off more to recognize when I'm facing a stereotype while being aware of this thing called stereotype threat? It seems like a lot of pressure--to feel responsible for not confirming a stereotype. Like you're letting down everyone facing that stereotype. Think I'll stick with stressing over what people think of me instead of what people think of people like me.
